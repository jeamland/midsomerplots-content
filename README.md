# MidsomerPlots content
This is a Midsomer Murders plot generator, available as a Node.js package and as an open web API, as used in the [@midsomerplots](https://twitter.com/midsomerplots) Twitter bot ([code](https://github.com/matthewberryman/midsomerplots)) and [Alexa skill](https://www.amazon.com/Across-the-Cloud-Pty-Ltd/dp/B07K87CPPQ) ([code](https://github.com/matthewberryman/midsomerplots-Alexa))

# Use as a Node.js module:

```javascript
const midsomerplots = require('midsomerplots-content');

// need to pass a seed = an integer, here just the time
midsomerplots.generate(Math.round((new Date()).getTime()/1000));
```

# Web API

```shell
curl "https://midsomerplots.acrossthecloud.net/plot?seed=n"
```
for some 32-bit integer n (if ommitted, will default to current Unix time in seconds)

Example response:
```json
{
  "plot": "A misunderstood Scottish flight attendant is found killed in a model village and tied down like Gulliver in Lilliput. Suspicion falls on Upton Snodsburyâ€™s real ale appreciation society, confused that the local date night might threaten to reveal that due to an off-by-one error, the meaning of life is actually 43.",
  "seed": 13
}
```
Alternatively, a maximum character limit may be passed:
```shell
curl "https://midsomerplots.acrossthecloud.net/plot?characterLimit=200"
```
Note that this is incompatible with the seed querystring parameter, and for low numbers introduces a delay or even the possibility of a timeout (after 30s) while it finds a short enough plot at random.
